# Academy PoW

This repo houses a Proof of Work based blockchain node for use in the Polkadot Blockchain Academy. It happens to be based on Substrate, but no Substrate knowledge is required.

## Connecting the UI

You can connect a UI to a public node by going to https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Facademy.bootnodes.net%2Falice#/explorer

## Building the Node

To help decentralize the network, you can compile the node by

1. Cloning this repo
2. Running `cargo build release`

## More Help
